Principle OOPS:

1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance : 
	
	task-1 => do the R & D with the examples on types of inheritance
	task-2 => do the R & D with the examples, how we can implement inheritance with abstract class and interface class
	
4. Polymorphism 

	task-3 => do the R & D with the examples, how to do method overloading and constructor overloading. 

5. Packages and Access modifiers

private, default(we have no keyword to declare default scope), protected and public

6. About Super most class in Java, Object class and its methods

	task4: try to do R & D on Object class all methods(if possible make programs.)
